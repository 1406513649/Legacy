# Add auto-completion and a stored history file of commands to your Python
# interactive interpreter. Requires Python 2.0+, readline. Autocomplete is bound
# to the Esc key by default (you can change it - see readline docs).
#
# Store the file in $HOME/Local/etc/python.d/pystartup, and set an environment
# variable to point to it:
# "export PYTHONSTARTUP=$HOME/Local/etc/python.d/pystartup" in bash.
